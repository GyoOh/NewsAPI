# News API

Welcome to News API, a web application for organizing and displaying images. With NEWS API.
I made this app as a way to learn and improve my skills in Javascript. 
I am constantly looking for ways to challenge myself and grow as a developer, and building this app gave me the opportunity to do so.
Overall, the process of building this app has been a great learning experience for me and I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.

## Features

I created this website as a way to provide users with easy access to the latest news from around the world. 
By allowing users to select their desired country and topic, the website is able to customize the news feed to their specific interests and needs.
I believe that staying up-to-date with current events is important, and this website aims to make it easy for users to do so. Whether you are looking for news on politics, sports, entertainment, or any other topic, this website has you covered.
The code for News API is organized into components, each with its own directory containing the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files for that component. The main entry point for the app is main.js, which renders the root component and mounts it to the DOM.
